# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This is a Machine learning and Deep Learning project performed on MNIST Handwritten digit dataset for recognizing the digits. In 'Digit Recognition using sklearn', Machine learning algorithms are performed for recognition of digits like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree and Random Forest. In 'Digit Recognition using Neural Network', Deep Learning algorithms are performed using tensorflow keras. Hope you enjoy it 😊...
